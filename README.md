# Project:  Credit-Card-Consumption-Case-Study
Predict credit consumption of customer for a Lending Bank

Understanding the consumption pattern for credit cards at an individual consumer level is important  for customer relationship management. This understanding allows banks to customize for consumers and make strategic marketing plans. Thus it is imperative to study the relationship between the characteristics of the consumers and their consumption patterns.

Business Objectives:

One of the leading banks provided below data
a. Customer Demographics

b. Customer Behavioural data (information on liabilities, assets and history of transactions with
the bank for each customer). Data has been provided for a particular set of customers' credit
card spend in the previous 3 months (April, May & June) and their expected average spend
in the coming 3 months (July, August & September)

c. Credit consumption 

Note: Some customers are having missing values for credit consumption. You need to build the model using customer’s data where credit consumption is non- missing’s. You need to predict the credit consumption for next three months for the customers having missing values.

Model Evaluation Metric:
You should validate model using Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) between the
predicted credit card consumption and Actual Credit Consumption.
